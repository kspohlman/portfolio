<!-- My Contributions -->

<p>I was one of two UX Designers on this project for Launch Scout. We completed a dedicated Discovery Phase to better understand user needs and develop mockups. The entire application's UI was refreshed with the brand's updated color palette and typefaces, while the employer side of the app received a UX refresh. We also built out the HTML and CSS for the updated portions of the application.</p>
