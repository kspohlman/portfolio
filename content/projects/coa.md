client: "Council on Aging of Southwest Ohio"
description: "Connecting home care workers with care recipients"
context: There is a national shortage of home care workers, leading to a growing crisis for many older adults in need of home care. Existing systems and processes are cumbersome and complex, making it difficult for care providers and recipients to connect and work together. Council on Aging of Southwest Ohio is working to change that.
challenge: Create a simple, intuitive platform for home care providers and care recipients to connect and manage their working relationship.
solution: A platform that simplifies the process of finding, hiring, and working with trusted in-home care providers. AddnAide has reduced the wait-time to receive care from months to days and empowers older adults, along with their families, to manage their own care.

<!-- My Contributions -->

<p>I served as the Project Lead and UX Designer for this project with Launch Scout. As Project Lead, I was responsible for keeping the team on task, on budget, and on time. As UX Designer, I helped lead a discovery phase to build shared understanding between the Launch Scout team and COA and create a storymap, release plan, and roadmap. I crafted the foundational design system alongside another UX Designer, iterated on the user experience and interface, and was responsible for building out the HTML and CSS.
